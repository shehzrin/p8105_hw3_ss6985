The dataset being explored is the `ny_noaa` dataset from the
`p8105.datasets` package. It contains a total of 2595176 rows and 7
columns, representing daily weather observations from various locations
in New York state. The columns include:

- `id`: a station identifier
- `date`: the date of the observation
- `prcp`: precipitation (tenths of mm)
- `snow`: snowfall (mm)
- `snwd`: snow depth (mm)
- `tmax`: maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
- `tmin`: minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)

Looking at the original dataset, we see it contains substantial amount
of missing data (lots of `NA` values across variables as seen from data
and `summary` command). There are 3387623 missing values in the dataset.

### Data cleaning:

``` r
noaatidy_df = ny_noaa |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    prcp = prcp / 10 ,
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax) / 10,
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin) / 10,
    year = as.numeric(year),
    day = as.numeric(day),
    month = recode_factor(month,
          "01" = "January",
          "02" = "February",
          "03" = "March",
          "04" = "April",
          "05" = "May",
          "06" = "June",
          "07" = "July",
          "08" = "August",
          "09" = "September",
          "10" = "October",
          "11" = "November",
          "12" = "December"
    ))
```

In the data cleaning step, we cleaned the variables names, created
separate variables for year, month, and day, and converted these
variables to numeric variables. Additionally, variables measured in
tenths of units were converted into just units (e.g., `tmin` was
measured in tenths of degrees C and converted into degrees C).

``` r
noaatidy_df |>
  count(snow) |>
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 282 × 2
    ##     snow       n
    ##    <int>   <int>
    ##  1     0 2008508
    ##  2    NA  381221
    ##  3    25   31022
    ##  4    13   23095
    ##  5    51   18274
    ##  6    76   10173
    ##  7     8    9962
    ##  8     5    9748
    ##  9    38    9197
    ## 10     3    8790
    ## # ℹ 272 more rows

For snowfall, the most commonly observed value is O (no recorded
snowfall on most days in NY state). This makes sense because snowfall
only occurs during certain times of the year and in specific conditions
(i.e., there are many days with no snowfall, and a small window for
possible snow). The second most commonly observed value is `NA`,
suggesting missingness.

### Making two-panel plot:

``` r
avg_temp_df = noaatidy_df |>
  filter(month %in% c("January", "July")) |>
  group_by(id, year, month) |>
  summarize(avg_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'id', 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
ggplot(avg_temp_df, aes(x = year, y = avg_tmax, group = id)) + geom_point() + geom_path() +
  facet_grid(. ~ month) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Maximum Temperature in January and July by Station",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Max Temperature (°C)",
  ) 
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_ss6985_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="90%" />
The two-panel plot shows the average maximum temperature in January and
July across years by station. July temperatures remain stable around
25–30°C, with fewer outliers (e.g., one possible at about 14ºC), overall
ranging from about 20ºC and 35ºC. Seasonal patterns are evident in
January, while July shows less variation. January temperatures fluctuate
more (within approximately -10 to 10ºC), with some potential outliers
(e.g., lowest max temperature at about -14ºC). There does not appear to
be a significant difference in average max temperatures in July or
January throughout the years. The average temperatures in January
(winter month) are also lower than in July (summer month). All stations
appear to follow similar trends of temperature peaks and valleys within
a month across the years.

### Making more two-panel plots:

``` r
tmax_tmin_df = noaatidy_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(
    title = "Maximum vs Minimum Temperatures",
    x = "Minimum Temperature (°C)",
    y = "Maximum Temperature (°C)"
  )

tmax_tmin_df
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_ss6985_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
snowfall_df = noaatidy_df |>
  filter(snow > 0, snow < 100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = snow, y = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Snowfall (0 < Snow < 100) by Year",
    x = "Snowfall (mm)",
    y = "Year"
  )

snowfall_df
```

    ## Picking joint bandwidth of 3.76

The first two-panel plot (hex plot) shows the `tmax` vs `tmin` for the
full dataset. The plot shows denser regions at moderate maximum
temperatures (around 0ºC to 35ºC) and minimum temperatures (around -10ºC
to 20ºC), suggesting most observations fall within that range. The
majority of the data cluster tightly in the center of the distribution.

The second two-panel plot shows the distribution of snowfall (values
greater than 0 and less than 100) separately by year. The ridgeline plot
shows a multimodal density of snowfall within a given year and
distributions across years with most snowfall events concentrated around
0-35mm. There is a another group of stations that see about 45mm of snow
and another group that sees nearly 80 mm. The overall patterns suggests
a fairly consistent distribution of snowfall values with some
variability across the years.
